# Application of Graph using Dijkstra using Algorithm


This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph to find the shortest path between two nodes. The graph is represented as a collection of nodes and edges, where each edge has a weight or cost associated with it.

Description
The Graph Application using Dijkstra's Algorithm allows users to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm, a popular graph traversal algorithm, to determine the optimal path based on the weights of the edges.

The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input the source and destination nodes. It then calculates and displays the shortest path along with the total cost or weight of the path. The algorithm takes into account the weights assigned to each edge to determine the most efficient route.

Features
